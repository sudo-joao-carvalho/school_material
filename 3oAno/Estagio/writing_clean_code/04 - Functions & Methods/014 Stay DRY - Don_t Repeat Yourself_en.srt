1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,280
Now, besides the levels of abstraction

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,710
and the different kinds of operations

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,940
you might be doing in a function,

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,960
there is another reason for

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,480
why you might want to split a function into smaller pieces.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,480
And that would be Reusability, because reusability matters

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,700
at least sometimes.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,060
In programming whenever you write any code

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,610
there is one very important rule,

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,440
which you should try to follow as often as possible,

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,600
in the best case of course you should always follow it.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,090
And that rule is that you shouldn't repeat yourself,

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,780
don't repeat yourself write DRY code,

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,880
that's something you will hear a lot and DRY code

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,440
simply means code where you don't repeat yourself.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,510
And this is not a complex concept at all,

17
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,120
it simply means don't write the same code

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,680
or very similar code in more than one place.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,810
Because if you do, you are repeating yourself,

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,640
and what's the problem with repeating yourself?

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,540
Well, whenever you need to change something about that code,

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,360
some logic or some error,

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,750
then you need to make this change in multiple places

24
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,100
throughout your application if you did repeat yourself,

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,190
if you never repeated yourself

26
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,130
then you only need to make the change once,

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,570
which is of course way better.

28
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,320
Now, here are some signs for a code which is not DRY.

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,180
So where you are repeating yourself,

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,700
one obvious sign of course is that you

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,520
find yourself copy and pasting code.

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,423
If you're doing that you are obviously repeating yourself,

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,940
but another sign would be

34
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,690
that you do need to change something,

35
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:55,080
and you see that you need to apply basically the same change

36
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,230
in different places in your code base.

37
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,504
Well, the reason for that probably

38
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:01,903
is that you did repeat yourself.
