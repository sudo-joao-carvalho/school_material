1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,860
By now in this course,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,560
we learned how to name things properly

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,010
and to not overuse comments.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,250
We haven't worked too much on the actual code

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,240
which we write except for the names

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,040
we assigned two things.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,830
Now therefore in this course section,

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,360
we are going to take a closer look at functions

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,680
because functions ultimately are where we write

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,550
the majority of our code, functions or methods.

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,700
And in this course section,

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,870
you will learn how to write clean functions

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,400
and we'll have a look at every aspect of functions.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,780
We'll have a look at the parameters,

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,570
the arguments you use

16
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,040
and functions and how to be clean there.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,010
And of course, we're going to have a look

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,530
at the function body,

19
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,100
and we're going to talk about the length of functions,

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,640
abstraction levels and how to properly split one function

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,389
into multiple functions to increase readability.

22
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:04,690
And as always, we're going to do this

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,780
with a bunch of examples, demos

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,980
and also a challenge for you.

25
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,093
So let's dive in.
