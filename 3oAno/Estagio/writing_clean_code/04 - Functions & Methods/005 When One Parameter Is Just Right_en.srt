1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,360
Now let's next have a look

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,680
at a couple of examples for one-argument functions.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,330
For example here, I have a log function

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,530
which simply wraps the built in console log method.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,570
Now we can argue whether such a function

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,680
makes too much sense, but we could be doing that,

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,320
if we want the option of quickly swapping console log

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,020
for some other outputting or logging mechanism.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,570
Then having our own logging function,

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,720
which we use for our program, could make sense,

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,720
because if we ever switched from console log

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,160
to some other mechanism,

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,720
we only need to make that switch in one place

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,340
instead of in multiple places.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,060
And then we have a function where it makes a lot of sense

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,470
that we need one-argument and just one-argument

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,510
and that would be the message which should be logged.

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,720
Now we could also come up with a way of writing this

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,180
such that no arguments are needed

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,970
again by creating a class,

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,110
which takes the message into constructor

22
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,760
and then has a no parameter log method.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,260
But I'm not to sure whether it is really as an improvement.

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,280
It's a lot of extra code and we just replace a function

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,880
where it was totally obvious that we might have a parameter

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,130
and where the kind and value of that parameter

27
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,650
also is no surprise at all.

28
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,810
So here, I'm absolutely not a fan of changing this

29
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,790
just for the sake of changing it.

30
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,860
Instead, I think the original example

31
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,450
with one-argument here makes a lot of sense

32
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,930
and is absolutely something we can keep around.

33
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,190
Now, here are more functions

34
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,630
where one-argument makes a lot of sense

35
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,790
and is totally obvious.

36
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,150
For example this square function,

37
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,090
which simply squares a number

38
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,740
and therefore for takes that number as a single parameter

39
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,120
or the email is valid function,

40
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,480
which takes the email address,

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,690
which should be validated as input.

42
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,640
These are all examples for functions,

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,540
which we can leave like that

44
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,210
and where having one-argument

45
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,820
is totally fine, obvious, easy to read

46
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,372
and easy to understand.
