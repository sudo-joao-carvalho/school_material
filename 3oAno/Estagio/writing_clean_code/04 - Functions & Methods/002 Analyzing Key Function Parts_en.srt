00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,200
In order to write clean code and functions,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,200
it is important that we reflect on what makes up a function.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,390
And for that, we should probably look at a function,

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,360
for example, this dummy example add function here.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,230
And just as a side note,

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,410
when I say function and what I show throughout this module

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,270
will also always apply to methods

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,100
since methods are really just functions inside of an object.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,350
So this is a function or method.

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,660
And of course we cannot just define this function

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,820
and write the code for this function.

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,140
We can also call this function

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,800
which could look something like this.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,560
And when we talk about clean code,

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,840
both parts should be clean.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,150
Calling the function should be readable

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,590
and also easy for us as a developer.

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,720
If we are calling a function,

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,880
we wanna have an easy time doing so.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,230
For example, the argument order should be clear.

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,910
And of course, working with the function,

22
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,310
writing code in an existing function,

23
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,930
maintaining existing functions should also be easy.

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,190
So the function body, the definition of a function,

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,693
should also be readable.

26
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,060
So therefore, it's the number and order of arguments

27
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,290
which matters to us because that defines how easy

28
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,250
and readable it is to call a function.

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,230
And it's the length of the function body, the amount of code

30
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,990
we have inside of a function which matters.

31
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,380
And in this section,

32
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,563
we are going to have a look at both aspects.
