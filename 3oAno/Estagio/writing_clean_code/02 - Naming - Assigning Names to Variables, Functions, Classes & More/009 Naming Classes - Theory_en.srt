1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,630
So now we had a closer look

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,470
at naming variables, properties, and functions and methods.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,040
Let's now have a look at naming classes.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,390
Here, we don't really have different cases to consider.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,010
We should always describe the object,

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,400
which is created when we instantiate the class.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,280
And that's important.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,370
Keep in mind that classes typically are used

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,390
to instantiate something.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,620
You can have static classes with static methods,

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,960
but typically you instantiate something

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,360
and therefore the class name should reflect

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,840
which kind of object gets created.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,710
Hence, classes might be named something like user

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,210
or product if they reflect these objects.

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,090
You can, as always, provide more details if it makes sense

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,000
and doesn't add redundancy.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,360
So your user class could become a customer class,

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,370
your product class could become a course class

20
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,990
if your product is an online course.

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,680
You can also use more than one word for class names,

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,100
but you should avoid redundant suffixes,

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,200
like DatabaseManager.

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,570
It can be intriguing to sometimes use names like this,

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,340
but always consider that classes are typically instantiated

26
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,820
and if you do that,

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,040
what is the instance of a DatabaseManager

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,630
if that's a person in your company,

29
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,350
the manager who manages all the databases?

30
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,170
It maybe makes sense,

31
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,990
but if it's an abstract thing in your code,

32
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,450
which just manages all the databases your application uses,

33
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,670
there might be a better name available.

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,220
Using names like this might make sense

35
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,810
if it's mostly a static class full of utility methods

36
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,150
or anything like that,

37
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,540
but typically, you wanna avoid them

38
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,070
and you wanna go for the clearer names instead,

39
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,190
which can also be instantiated.

40
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,630
And that's really all you gotta know about classes.

41
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,650
They should describe the object,

42
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,653
which is built with help of the class.
