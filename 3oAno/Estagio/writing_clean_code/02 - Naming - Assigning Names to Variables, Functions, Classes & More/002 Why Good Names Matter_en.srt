00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,220
When it comes to naming things

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,350
in development, there is one simple overarching rule,

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,500
and that would be that names should be meaningful.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,610
This really is all, this is the core idea.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,030
Whenever you name something,

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,670
no matter if that's a variable or a function or a class,

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,840
the name should be meaningful.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,760
It should transport what's stored in a variable

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,540
or what a function or method does

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,730
without having to look at the code

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,830
inside of that function or method,

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,640
or without exploring the value stored in a variable.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,380
For example, consider this code snippet.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,290
It's not a lot of lines,

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,450
but it's really not clear at all what's going on there.

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,450
const us equals new MainEntity us process if login,

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,710
what are we doing there?

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,070
What's this main entity?

19
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,130
What does process do and what is the value of login?

20
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,620
Is it the function for which existence we check?

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,430
Is it a Boolean value?

22
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,650
Is it a string, an error or code?

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,660
We don't know at all.

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,410
And now consider this alternative.

25
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,990
It's the same code, but it's way clearer.

26
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,970
It's now obvious that we are creating a user,

27
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,910
which we are then saving, maybe to a file or to a database.

28
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,200
This might not matter to us,

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,100
but we are saving the user

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,990
and we got isLoggedIn instead of login,

31
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,280
making it clear that this very likely holds the result

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,310
of checking whether that user is logged in or not.

33
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,420
So a Boolean value, true or false.

34
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,060
This is now very readable and very easy to understand,

35
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,500
even though it's the same number of lines.

36
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,980
The only difference is that now we have meaningful names.

37
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,120
So picking good names in your code really matters.

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,830
If we have well-named things, variables and so on,

39
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,830
in our code, we allow our readers,

40
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,110
so the people reading our code, to understand that code

41
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,130
without going through all the details,

42
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,520
without diving into it in detail.

43
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,530
Consider these examples.

44
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,130
In all three examples,

45
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,790
it's pretty clear what this code does,

46
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,650
even though we don't know the details.

47
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,570
We don't need to dive into the rest of the code

48
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,010
just to understand these snippets.

49
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,440
That's why names matter.

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,470
Now, I will emphasize right away.

51
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,700
We will not always agree, because obviously,

52
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,630
there is more than one way of naming something.

53
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,760
In this course section, I'll explore the rules

54
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,730
we can follow to come up with good names, but ultimately,

55
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,970
you will still always have more than one option.

56
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,350
For example, here, this is readable, I would say.

57
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,530
We are probably creating some admin user,

58
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,130
but this here is also readable and not necessarily worse.

59
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,140
You could definitely find arguments

60
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,870
for either of the two names.

61
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,590
And it's up to you how you wanna name something

62
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,540
in such cases.

63
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,130
There are however, also names which clearly are bad.

64
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,350
And that's what I'll focus on in this course section,

65
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,940
so that by the end of the section,

66
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,600
you have a clear understanding of what makes up a good name

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
and what makes up a bad name.

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,530
And then of course, it's up to you to pick

69
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,913
which good name you wanna go with.
