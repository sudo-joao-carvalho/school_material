1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,780
So finally let's get started

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,130
with our first key pain point

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,130
or first area of improvement and that would be names.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,600
In this module, we are going to focus on naming things.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,520
So on assigning good names,

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,500
we'll focus on all the nameable things in development,

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,915
which would be variables, constants and properties,

8
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:31,493
functions and methods and of course also classes.

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,450
We are going to explore why names matter exactly

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,630
and how good names can help us.

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,590
We'll then most importantly,

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,430
dive into rules and concepts for assigning good names,

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,270
and we'll compare these names to bad names

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,130
to really see the difference

15
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,950
and of course, as promised,

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,030
we'll have plenty of small examples and demos,

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,530
and also a challenge for you at the end of this module

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,133
to apply what you'll learned.
