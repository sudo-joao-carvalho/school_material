1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:02,953
So in this coord,

2
00:00:02,953 --> 00:00:05,689
we are working with some geometric objects.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,720
We've got a point class, we've got a rectangle class.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,590
At the end of the file, we are calling build_stuff.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,570
We are in the end, we are constructing a point

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,610
and a rectangle storing both invariables.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,650
We then return to rectangle here.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,220
Hence, it's getting stored in my rect.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,460
And then I simply print the area of that rectangle,

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,460
and I called the end_points method in that rectangle class.

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,490
That's what the coord is doing.

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,670
And there are a couple of names which are a good,

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,130
and a couple of names, which are bad.

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,190
Now, good names would be point and rectangle for example.

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,340
I'm happy with these class names.

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,010
You can always be creative and come up with other names.

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,760
But I think these names are pretty straightforward

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,703
and there is no need to change them.

19
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,310
If we have a look at this constructor function

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,950
in the point class though,

21
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,400
there already are names I'm not so happy about,

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,160
and that would be coordX and coordY.

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,300
Now the thing is, these names are not horrible.

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,180
You can leave them, they are not bad,

25
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,110
but they are also not great,

26
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,320
because they do have a bit of redundant information

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,050
attached to them.

28
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,190
If the class is named point

29
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,070
and we do have an X and a Y argument,

30
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,090
it's pretty clear what this stands for.

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,500
It's clear that these are some coordinates.

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,760
So this coord prefix is really redundant.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,760
We could just use X and Y here instead of coordY and coordX.

34
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,860
There is no reason to keep that around.

35
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,270
So I prefer this, and this is a rear case.

36
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,250
Here, I prefer the shorter version,

37
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,610
the abbreviation so to say,

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,360
of a certain name instead of the longer form.

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,350
But because X and Y are common knowledge,

40
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,910
it's clear that we have X and Y coordinates,

41
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,190
in a coordinate system.

42
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,300
And because it's in a point class,

43
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,690
I think these names are super clear

44
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,830
and actually more descriptive than the longer names,

45
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,930
since it's less to read.

46
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,870
Now, what about the rectangle?

47
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,620
The class name is fine, in the constructor here again,

48
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,380
I'm not too happy with all those names though.

49
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,950
We got the starting_point and then broad and high.

50
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,760
Now, starting_point could be okay.

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,750
This is basically a point in the coordinate system

52
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,120
where the rectangle would be drawn

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,780
or where the starting point of that drawing would be.

54
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,700
It's there for okay but I think a better and more concise

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,500
term could be origin.

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,330
Now again, this up to you,

57
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,420
this is not something you have to replace,

58
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,990
starting_point would be okay, but I prefer origin

59
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,840
because it is a bit more concise.

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,670
Now when it comes to broad and high,

61
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,470
I'm absolutely not happy with these names.

62
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,480
Broad and high that is basically slang

63
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,500
or some strange wording, strange language.

64
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,280
It would be more appropriate to use something like width,

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,040
and height here.

66
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,600
These are the proper measures,

67
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,170
which we're used to from other areas as well.

68
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,620
Even outside of programming,

69
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,550
we talk about widths and Heights,

70
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,920
not about a couch being broad for example.

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,650
So here I wanna go with width instead of broad,

72
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,883
and height instead of high.

73
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,500
This is definitely cleaner.

74
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,790
Now, what about the area here?

75
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,730
This is a method in this rectangle

76
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,960
and typically methods should have a name

77
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,080
that describes the operation, which is performed.

78
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,810
And area is not a command.

79
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,720
It sounds like a property.

80
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,240
Now, property-like names could be fine

81
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,610
if we would be returning a bullion here,

82
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,300
or actually also, if this would be a getter,

83
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,680
which is a special kind of method.

84
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,510
But since neither of the two things is the case here,

85
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,743
I prefer a get area here, because that makes it clear

86
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:02,810
that we can call this method

87
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,760
to get the area of this rectangle,

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,930
which is exactly what's happening.

89
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,100
Of course, here, by the way,

90
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,010
we should also use width and height

91
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,083
since I changed these names up there.

92
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,620
Now, what about the end_points?

93
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,910
In the end this method, is printing a bunch of information

94
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,790
about this rectangle.

95
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,980
It's printing the X and Y coordinates

96
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,340
of the Starting Point.

97
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,550
And then basically it prints where the rectangle ends

98
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,840
on the X-axis and where it ends on the Y-axis.

99
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,270
And we also have these two helper variables here.

100
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,010
First of all, of course, we should make sure

101
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,950
that we also use width and height down there,

102
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,560
since we changed that.

103
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,810
And here we changed starting_point to origin,

104
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,700
so we wanna replace this in all four places as well.

105
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,160
And coordX now is just X, coordY is just Y.

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,700
So we also need to adjust these things here.

107
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,040
Now about the naming, we introduce in this method itself,

108
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,800
namely the top right and the bottom left name,

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,820
which we introduce here and which we then use down there.

110
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,960
Are these good names?

111
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,440
I would actually say, you can go with them.

112
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,830
You will definitely also be able to find alternatives,

113
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,410
which you personally might prefer,

114
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,140
but these names are pretty descriptive.

115
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,300
It's clear that this is the top right corner

116
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,580
of the rectangle and that this is the bottom left corner.

117
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,580
We could name it top right corner X or something like this,

118
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,180
but this would actually be a bit redundant

119
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,310
since the top right corner naturally only differs

120
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,860
in the X value from the origin.

121
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,410
On the Y axis, it's on the same level as the starting point.

122
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,630
So the x axis, the x value is the only point,

123
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,160
which will be different.

124
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,750
For this of course, you have to keep in mind,

125
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,560
that coordinate systems in programming,

126
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,340
typically start in the top left corner.

127
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,010
And with that, it makes perfect sense

128
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,110
to name this top right, to indicate

129
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,000
that this is the X value, where the rectangle ends.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,090
But again, you definitely also can find alternatives here,

131
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,603
which also could be fine.

132
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,520
However, I will stick to these names

133
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,760
and therefore leave this method as it is.

134
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,210
Now, for the rest of this coord file,

135
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,880
here, we got the build_stuff function.

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,010
And as you can imagine, build_stuff is not a great name.

137
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,130
This is slang, and it's totally not clear what it's doing,

138
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,110
unless we look into it.

139
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,516
A better name here would be build_rectangle,

140
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:35,947
because this is what this function does in the end.

141
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:38,992
It constructs a new rectangle by first of all,

142
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:41,850
building the origin point and then building

143
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,930
the rectangle itself and then returning it.

144
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,070
So build_rectangle is a better name

145
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,913
and should also be used down there.

146
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,080
Now, main point is also kind of a bad name.

147
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,460
It's not clear that this will simply be the origin

148
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,750
of the rectangle,

149
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,180
So a better name might be rectangle_origin,

150
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,780
because that is what we plan to do with that point.

151
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,210
It should be the origin of the rectangle.

152
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,073
So let's name it as such, and then use it down there.

153
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:13,660
Rect is an abbreviation, arguably one which is clear,

154
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,400
and still there is little that speaks against

155
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,563
simply calling this, rectangle.

156
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,830
With that, I'm happy with the function

157
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,250
and we can move down to the last lines.

158
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,692
my_rect of course, is a horrible name.

159
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:28,750
I mean, what should this be?

160
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,060
Is it the developers rectangle,

161
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,690
the rectangle of the user running this coord?

162
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,660
It doesn't make any sense.

163
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,610
This should just be rectangle.

164
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,870
Or if you had some other more specific version,

165
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,349
like user rectangle,

166
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:44,520
then of course you should use that name.

167
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,810
But don't use my_rectangle or anything like that.

168
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,780
Also not the_rectangle.

169
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,960
What would that be?

170
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,910
Instead in this case, I'll just go with rectangle.

171
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,570
And then of course, call rectangle.getArea here,

172
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,550
since we renamed this method

173
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,180
and rectangle.end_points, down there.

174
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,630
And actually this brings me back to this method.

175
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,630
One thing I forgot end_points, is a name you could keep,

176
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,340
but we actually are not just printing the end_points

177
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,340
of this rectangle, but also the Starting Point coordinates.

178
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,140
So actually, I personally think

179
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,360
that a name like print_coordinates, is way better.

180
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,040
It also makes it clear that we're printing something,

181
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,660
which end_points doesn't make clear at all.

182
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,730
It does not indicate what's happening.

183
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,210
It's already a bad name

184
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,909
because it's clearly not describing a command.

185
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,159
It sounds like a property.

186
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,480
So print_coordinates is way better.

187
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,940
It makes it clear that this method will simply print

188
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,480
all the key coordinates of this rectangle.

189
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,147
Hence, this the name I'll go with here,

190
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:53,113
and this is now the name I'll use down there.

191
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,270
And whenever error I spotted here,

192
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,270
which I of course all the one I fix,

193
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,690
here, I have self.height.y, this of course is wrong.

194
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,330
This should be self.origin.y and self.origin.x down there.

195
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,470
And self.origin.y down there.

196
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,210
I had a copy and paste error there.

197
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,900
So now with that, this is the finished coord

198
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,710
and we could now also execute it,

199
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,510
which again, you don't have to do,

200
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,500
but if we do that, we get the area of this rectangle

201
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,962
and we then get the key coordinates.

202
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,900
Hence, this is now the challenge solved.

203
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,500
And of course, you will pretty much certainly have different

204
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,810
names than I do.

205
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,080
This does not mean that your names are wrong.

206
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,710
I just walked you through my names.

207
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,220
And most importantly, for the reasons

208
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,847
why I chose those names.

209
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:42,880
If those reasons also apply for your names,

210
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,700
if your names also meet the requirements

211
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,580
and fulfill the rules outlined in this section,

212
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,610
they are of course also fine.

213
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,360
Ultimately there will never be

214
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,100
just one single correct name for something.

215
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,140
There are just are a couple of bad names.

216
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,723
As you learned in this section.
