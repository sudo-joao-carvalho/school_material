1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,790
So now it's again time for more examples,

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,030
this time focused on classes.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,870
And again, we got these three kinds of names

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,340
and the question is which kind of object is described?

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,760
And let's say that is a user again.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,490
How should the classes be named then?

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,170
When it comes to bad names,

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,400
we could use something like UEntity or ObjA.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,440
These again are very unspecific.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,890
They could hold anything.

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,803
These are not the names you wanna use.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,640
Better names would be something like UserObj or AppUser.

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,130
These names are okay,

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,310
but actually we have redundant information in there.

15
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,460
Of course, a user is an object.

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,350
And of course, a user in our application

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,010
is an application user.

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,690
So using these names might not make too much sense

19
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,640
unless you have a very good reason for doing that.

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,870
Now, good names could be just User

21
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,710
or the more specific kind of user Admin

22
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,290
or also customer and so on.

23
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,000
This is fine and specific enough,

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,660
or in the case of Admin, even very specific.

25
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,310
So these are great names to use.

26
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,110
And that, of course, again means that it's now time for you

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,460
to practice this.

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,820
Again, take the chance to pause the video

29
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,070
and then come up with some names for a database,

30
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,700
which should be described by a class.

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,020
So let's say you are creating a class

32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,010
which then has methods which you can use in your code

33
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,110
for connecting to a database

34
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,320
and for sending queries to that database.

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,190
That would be a thing you would definitely have

36
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,520
in a lot of applications.

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,423
And the question now is, how could you name such a class?

38
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,110
Here are some bad names.

39
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,950
The problem with these is that Data and DataStorage

40
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,351
are very unspecific or even describing the wrong thing.

41
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,990
DataStorage doesn't have to be a database.

42
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,350
It could also be a file storage or a storage in memory.

43
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,190
So this is very unspecific and even a bit misleading.

44
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,090
Better names could be Db or just Data,

45
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,620
but it's still not 100% specific,

46
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,479
especially Data is almost a bad name

47
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,130
because Data again could be anything.

48
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,230
So this might not even be okay.

49
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,350
Now, good names, on the other hand, are of course Database

50
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,000
or the specific kind of database which is being created.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,120
If you have a SQL database

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,520
and your class has all the methods it needs

53
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,160
for interacting with this kind of database,

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,973
SQLDatabase, of course, is a great name.
