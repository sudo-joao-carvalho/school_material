1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,959
So let's now dig a bit deeper

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,410
and let's start with variables, constants, and properties.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,570
How should this be named?

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,420
We can differentiate between three main kinds of values

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,580
which are being stored in them.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,021
Our values could be objects and this includes lists

7
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:24,600
or maps or any other more complex data structure.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,894
Our value could be a simple number or string,

9
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,890
or our value could be a boolean.

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,200
And you can already tell by the color coding here

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
that there seems to be a difference

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,550
between booleans and the other kinds of values.

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,890
Now, if your value,

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,970
which you store in a variable constant

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,660
or property is an object or an object to like thing

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,406
then the name which you assigned to your variable

17
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:52,426
or property should simply describe the value.

18
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:54,859
So if you are storing a user object

19
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:58,540
in your variable, name the variable user.

20
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,866
If you are storing an object which describes a database

21
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:04,301
and offers database operations

22
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:08,030
you might wanna name the variable database.

23
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,579
If your value is a number or a string, so some text,

24
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,280
then you also just wanna describe the value.

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,780
If you have a variable that holds the name of a user,

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,410
you might just wanna call it name.

27
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,558
The same of course if it's a property in a user object.

28
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:26,470
If you have a variable

29
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,110
or property, which holds an age

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,420
you might wanna call it age, just like that.

31
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,490
Now for booleans, there is a special case.

32
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,570
For booleans your name should simply be a question

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,750
that can be answered with true or false.

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,534
So you might name your variable

35
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:47,400
something like is active or logged in

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,200
because that can be yes or no and therefore true or false.

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,270
You are active, or you are not it's an either or choice.

38
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,072
So for a booleans we want this is something naming

39
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:02,350
or name like logged in,

40
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,800
which also can be answered with yes or no.

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,130
Now you might wanna consider providing more details

42
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,871
and more information where it makes sense

43
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:15,990
but you don't wanna introduce extra redundancy.

44
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,041
For example, if your user in a certain branch

45
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,185
of your code is always an authenticated user,

46
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:23,639
you could consider naming

47
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,600
that variable authenticated user to make it really clear

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,226
to everyone who reads that code

49
00:02:29,226 --> 00:02:33,200
that you're only acting on an authenticated user here.

50
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,408
If it's a customer, you could name it customer

51
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:38,960
instead of user, to have this more specific name.

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,770
If it's a SQL database

53
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,930
you could use that as a name to make it really clear

54
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,940
which kind of database you are working on.

55
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,363
If you store just a first name of a user in a certain field

56
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:51,980
you might wanna name it first name instead

57
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,407
of just name, to be more specific about the kind

58
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,700
of name being stored in there.

59
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,226
On the apprehend I would argue that age

60
00:02:58,226 --> 00:03:00,560
is already pretty specific.

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,240
So you probably can't be more specific there.

62
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,297
So it's not about making your names as long as possible

63
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:08,770
but just about making them as clear

64
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,510
and as easy to understand as possible.

65
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,400
And sometimes shorter is better.

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,270
Sometimes longer is better.

67
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,493
Obviously this is also something which will come

68
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:20,620
with experience but also with help of the demos

69
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,970
and exercises you will see through out this course.

70
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,382
Now for booleans it's the same.

71
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:27,888
You can add more details if it makes sense.

72
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:31,273
For example, if is active refers to a user,

73
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:34,001
you could name it is active user logged in

74
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,860
on the other hand will typically always refer to a user.

75
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,460
So for example, using user is logged in

76
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,988
instead of just logged in

77
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:46,333
is longer but not necessarily better.
