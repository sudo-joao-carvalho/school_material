1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,990
Now that we saw many examples,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,380
learned about many rules,

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,970
and saw a complete transformation step by step in action

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,350
in the last lecture, it's time for your challenge,

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,600
time for you to apply what you learned.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,650
And for this attached, you'll find this example code,

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,420
again written in Python,

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,840
and again you can execute it but you don't have to.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,720
Instead, you should understand what this code does,

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,450
and then you should find all the places

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,380
where you're not happy with a certain name.

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,880
No matter if it's a class name, if it's a variable name,

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,920
a function name, a method name, whatever it is.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,830
Now, I will say right away, not all names in here are bad.

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,490
There are names which are absolutely fine.

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,540
You can still, of course, come up with other names

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,340
if you prefer it, but of course most importantly,

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,390
you should focus on the bad names

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,170
and you should come up with better alternatives.

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,590
Once you did that, have a look at my solution video

21
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,060
to see which bad names I identified

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,200
and which better names I came up with

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,053
so that you get a feeling for how I tackled and solved this.
