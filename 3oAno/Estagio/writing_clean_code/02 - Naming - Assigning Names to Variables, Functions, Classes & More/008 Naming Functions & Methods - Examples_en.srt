1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,670
So therefore, it's again time

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,590
for some specific examples,

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,880
now on functions and method names,

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,160
again with bad, okay, and good names.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,550
Now, let's say we have a function that saves a user

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,060
or saves user data to a database.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,970
How could we name this function or method?

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,410
Well, bad names would be something like process or handle.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,740
This is very generic. These could be doing anything.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,070
Yes, it could be processing or handling a user,

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,340
but we could also be processing an order,

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,400
so this is not telling us anything.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,970
In addition, it's not clear whether process means save

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,670
or update or delete.

15
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,640
It could be anything,

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,780
so this is definitely very unspecific

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,450
and not the naming you wanna use.

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,170
Now, when it comes to okay names,

19
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,511
we could have something like save or storeData.

20
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,530
Now, the good thing is that now it's clear

21
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,410
that something is being saved,

22
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,110
but it's still not necessarily clear what is being saved.

23
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,460
Of course, if save is a method on a user object,

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,030
then it's way clearer and then save is perfectly fine.

25
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,330
But if you just have a function called save,

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,530
which is not called on an object

27
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,940
but which instead for example

28
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,130
receives an object as an argument,

29
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,960
there might be a better name which you can choose.

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,010
For example, saveUser or you use what I just said

31
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,280
and you instead make that a method on a user object,

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,390
which now again makes it very clear

33
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,770
that it's probably this object which is being saved.

34
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,830
Here, the intent is very clear,

35
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,880
especially if you use the method approach.

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,470
And again, just as before,

37
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,380
we are going to see more examples throughout this section.

38
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,700
But before we do that,

39
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,480
it's again time for you to pause this video

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,200
and try this on your own.

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,810
Let's say we have a function

42
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,140
which validates some user input.

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,970
How would you name that?

44
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,810
And by the way,

45
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,400
it doesn't necessarily have to return true or false.

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,723
So how would you name this function or this method then?

47
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,730
Well, bad names, again, could be process or now also save.

48
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,789
Validating is not the same as saving.

49
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,800
We might save after validating something,

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,270
but first we validate it and there nothing gets saved.

51
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,650
So this is unspecific in the case of process

52
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,533
and even misleading in the case of save.

53
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,547
Now, better names could be validateSave or check.

54
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,210
ValidateSave could imply that we do both,

55
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,580
validation and saving, so it's still not ideal,

56
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,030
but if that is what we do, it's okay.

57
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,420
Check is okay.

58
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,840
It makes it clear that we're checking something,

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,670
but it's also not really specific

60
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,170
and it leaves us guessing.

61
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,540
Both names leave us guessing on what's happening exactly.

62
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,560
So better names could be validate

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,670
or if true or false is returned isValid.

64
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,210
Validate could be called

65
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,060
if we are not returning true or false,

66
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,940
but if we are for example throwing an error

67
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,078
if the validation fails.

68
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:05,180
isValid, on the other hand, is a great name

69
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,423
if that function does return true or false.
