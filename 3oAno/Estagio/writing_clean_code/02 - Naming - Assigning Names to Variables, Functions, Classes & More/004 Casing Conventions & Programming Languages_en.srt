1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,140
Now, before we dive

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,870
into the concrete examples,

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,480
and the different variations, and so on,

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,270
we also have to stop at the important topic of casing.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,270
In programming, we got four main ways of writing our names,

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,930
four main casings,

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,919
and that would be snake_case, camelCase,

8
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:25,967
PascalCase, and kebap-case.

9
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:26,800
Now, snake_case looks like this, is_valid, send_response,

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,810
where multiple words are separated with an underscore

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,220
and everything is lowercase.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,550
And, for example, you use snake_case a lot in Python.

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,960
There, you use it for variable names,

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,770
for function names, and for method names.

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,280
And that's what you saw in the initial examples

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,900
in the first course section already.

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,410
Now, Python uses snake_case.

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,730
Many other programming languages,

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,950
like Java or JavaScript, use camelCase,

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,510
which looks like this, isValid, sendResponse.

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,800
The same name, but now not with an underscore between words,

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,720
but instead there is no separation between words

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,550
except for the starting character of the next word in line.

24
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,060
The first character in the name is always a lowercase one,

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,040
like the i in isValid and the s in sendResponse,

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,960
but then every word in that phrase starts

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,560
with an uppercase character, like the uppercase V in Valid

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,810
and the uppercase R in Response.

29
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,550
Again, this camelCase notation is used

30
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,590
by many other programming languages,

31
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,660
but it's used for the same things as Python uses snake_case,

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,683
and that would be variables, functions, and methods.

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,830
Now, another notation which we know is PascalCase.

34
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,070
It looks like this,

35
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,050
and this is used by many programming languages,

36
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,707
for example, by Python, and Java,

37
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:58,870
and JavaScript for class names.

38
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,473
Class names are typically written in PascalCase.

39
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,560
And when it comes to kebap-case, it looks like this,

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,580
and we, for example, know this from HTML,

41
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,759
where we can use it to assign names

42
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,480
to custom HTML elements we might be building.

43
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,740
Now, these are the four main ways of writing things,

44
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,010
and mostly it comes down to conventions

45
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,590
when to use which notation.

46
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,330
I outlined the most important conventions here.

47
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,920
For example, for Python, we use snake_case

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,060
for variables, functions, and methods.

49
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,290
And style guides for your favorite programming language

50
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,530
typically tell you which notation to use for what.

51
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,530
I wanna emphasize, of course,

52
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,170
that no matter which casing you use,

53
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,350
the name in the end is always the same,

54
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,930
just the way you write it is different,

55
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,660
and therefore, again, which programming language you choose

56
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,280
does not really have an impact on how to write clean code.

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,150
This is just an extra convention you should keep in mind

58
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,520
because, of course, following language-specific conventions

59
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,513
is also a part of writing clean code.
