1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,700
So how should we name

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,560
functions and methods then?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,630
Well, here we can also differentiate

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,490
between functions or methods,

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,260
which do perform some kind of operation,

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,990
and that really can be any kind of operation.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,250
It can be an operation where data

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,000
in an object gets changed.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,230
It can be a calculation which returns a value,

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,130
but the other kind of function we can have a look at

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,250
is a function which computes a boolean specifically.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,543
So which returns a boolean value.

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,661
Now for the first case that we have any kind of operation,

14
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,700
the function or method name

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,800
should really just describe that operation.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,300
So for example, getUser,

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,770
makes it really clear that we're getting some user,

18
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,660
maybe from a database,

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,210
response.send

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,550
makes it really clear

21
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,600
that we're probably sending the response

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,230
on which we execute this method.

23
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,380
Now for the boolean case,

24
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,180
we again wanna answer a true or false question

25
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,090
just as with the properties and variables and constants.

26
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,170
So here as an exception,

27
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,720
our function could not describe the operation,

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,330
but instead the result,

29
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,010
and this is really only the case where booleans,

30
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,630
where you wanna do that.

31
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,835
So here your method or your functions

32
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:20,090
could be named isValid

33
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,740
or something like isPaid method on a purchase.

34
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,320
To return true if that purchase was paid

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,380
and false if it wasn't.

36
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,810
Now just as before,

37
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,833
more details are always great

38
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,900
unless they are redundant.

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,130
So for example,

40
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,440
if we have a function

41
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,160
which retrieves a user from a database,

42
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,750
but it does so by identifying the user by email,

43
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,410
we could name the function getUserByEmail.

44
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,540
To make it really clear

45
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,020
that it's not fetching a user by ID

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,570
or by any arbitrary criteria,

47
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,970
but that it's always to email.

48
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,460
Now for response send

49
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,330
on the other hand,

50
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,130
this already is pretty clear.

51
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,310
Something like response.send response,

52
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,240
simply wouldn't make a lot of sense.

53
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,150
It's clear that we're sending this response.

54
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,199
For booleans just as before,

55
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,880
we can always add more details

56
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,350
if it makes sense.

57
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,220
For example, if we have a function

58
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,570
which validates email addresses specifically,

59
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,440
we could name the function, emailIsValid.

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,143
instead of just isValid.

61
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,180
On the other hand again

62
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,260
for a purchase is paid.

63
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,960
This is already pretty clear,

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,000
more details could be added in some use cases and scenarios,

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,340
but in most scenarios,

66
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,063
it's probably good like this.
