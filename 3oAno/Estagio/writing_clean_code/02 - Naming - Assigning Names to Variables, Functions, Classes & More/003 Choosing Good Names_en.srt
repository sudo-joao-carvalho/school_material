1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,997
So before we explore any bad

2
00:00:03,997 --> 00:00:06,790
or dirty code, let's dive right in.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,790
How do we name things correctly in our code?

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,200
Well, let's differentiate between these three main blocks,

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,170
which I outlined

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,100
and let's have a look at the different rules.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,840
Variables and constants

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,640
and of course, also properties and objects,

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,880
which would be in the same category,

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,610
are all data containers you could say.

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,688
We use them to store some data.

12
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:32,780
That could be some data entered by a user,

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,180
for example, in a web application.

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,820
It could be the result of validating that user input.

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,600
It could be a list of products,

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,170
a single product, anything like that.

17
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,860
Here, for the names of these variables,

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,790
constants and properties,

19
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,230
we typically wanna use nouns or short phrases

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,550
with adjectives, which describe what's inside

21
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,370
of the data container.

22
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,220
For example, something like userData or just user.

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,580
Something like isValid if we store a Boolean.

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,960
These would be good names

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,590
and we are going to see way more examples

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,670
throughout this section.

27
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,390
No worries.

28
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,600
So that's how we wanna name our variables

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,390
and constants and properties.

30
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,226
We wanna describe what is being stored in them.

31
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:23,140
Now, when it comes to functions and methods,

32
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,720
the idea is a different one.

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,520
Here, we don't store something in that function,

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,090
I mean, there is code inside of it

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,390
but that code executes once a function is called

36
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,030
and therefore, in the end,

37
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,290
functions and methods are, of course, commands,

38
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,440
which we can execute on demand

39
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,395
or we calculate values which we return.

40
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:48,395
So there are commands or calculated values you could say.

41
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,610
For example, we could have a function

42
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,810
which sends data to a server.

43
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,610
We could have a function or method

44
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,992
which validates some user input.

45
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,430
And therefore, for function and method names,

46
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,660
we typically go with verbs

47
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,200
or again, short phrases with adjectives.

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,250
So here we could have something like sendData

49
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,920
as a name for the function which sends function

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
to a server.

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,480
Or inputIsValid for the validation function.

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,720
Maybe also just isValid.

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,200
This would also be okay.

54
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,840
So here we could have the same name

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,790
as for the variable on the left

56
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,870
because we wanna describe a value,

57
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,320
which is produced by the function here then.

58
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,220
Though I will say that Booleans

59
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,880
are a special case here.

60
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,310
If we had a function which produces a user object,

61
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,780
for example, we might wanna call that function getUser

62
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,910
or createUser or something like that.

63
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,990
But again, you will see more examples

64
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,410
for these different scenarios throughout this section.

65
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,520
Now, when it comes to naming classes,

66
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,230
it's important to understand

67
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,520
and keep in mind that we use classes in our code

68
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,900
to create things, to create objects.

69
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,450
For example, a user object or a product

70
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,850
or an HTTP request body,

71
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,960
which we wanna parse, something like this.

72
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,490
And therefore, for naming classes,

73
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,820
we also use nouns or short phrases with nouns.

74
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,160
So simply multiple nouns combined with each other.

75
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,400
Something like User or RequestBody,

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,581
which would be these multiple nouns being combined.

77
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:25,270
That's how we wanna use classes.

78
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,880
And if you keep these basic rules in mind,

79
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,930
you've already got a good foundation

80
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,070
for naming your code correctly,

81
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,080
for naming the things in your code correctly.

82
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,570
But of course, we're now also going

83
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,714
to explore the different niche cases, variations

84
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:42,670
and then also how to pick the best noun

85
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,297
for a given value being stored in a variable, for example.

86
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:49,330
Because using a noun is just the start.

87
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,075
Of course, you wanna use the best noun,

88
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:55,080
which best describes what's inside a variable

89
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,610
or what's inside a function and so on.

90
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,750
So that's, of course, what we're going to explore

91
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,950
throughout this section.
