00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,340
Now before we dive

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,360
into this messy code I showed you

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,260
and before we will start cleaning it up,

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,680
let me give you an overview over the various techniques

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,130
and rules which we have when it comes

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,700
to cleaning up controlled structures.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,770
Because of course an important part

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,000
of using controlled structures in a clean way

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,450
is that you are wide deep nesting.

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,740
To achieve this, we can use factory functions

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,070
and polymorphism and we'll of course see what exactly

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,930
that is and how it helps us,

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,100
you can also tweak your naming

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,610
or the way you formulate your if checks a little bit

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,560
and for example, prefer positive checks over negative checks

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,040
because positive checks are typically a bit easier

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,680
to understand and you can also utilize errors

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,920
and not just see them as a problem

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,730
but instead use them in a smart way to get rid

20
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,210
of certain if checks which you don't need actually.

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,920
Of course, the composition and polymorphism

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,500
and the error part here will also be important tools

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,650
when it comes to achieving the main goal

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,210
of avoiding deep nesting.

25
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,600
Now these are all concepts we're going to have a look at

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,029
throughout this core section but I will actually start

27
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:19,903
with a different concept, guards.
