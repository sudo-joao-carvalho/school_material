1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,530
Now, we're almost done

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,060
with this long practical section here.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,250
There are still minor improvements we could make

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,503
and you should consider.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,890
And that would, for example, be that in showErrorMessage,

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,860
we sometimes call it with just a message.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,110
And sometimes, of course,

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,500
we call it with a message and an item,

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,060
which is why we accept both; message and item.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,210
Now, this is okay, we have this if check here,

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,678
but we can actually get rid of this pointless if check here

12
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:37,810
if we simply always console.log the item,

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,640
but make sure that the item is never undefined, but instead,

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,930
maybe give it a default value of an empty object or a map.

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,820
And default parameter values, of course, are also accepted

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,020
and supported in many programming languages.

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,660
So now we ensure that there always is an item,

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,520
even if it's just an empty map,

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
which we then therefore output here.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,160
So that's a tiny improvement we can make here to get rid

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,200
of one extra if check,

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,830
because as you saw throughout this section,

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,213
getting rid of if checks can really help with readability.
