<p>There's one <strong>additional tweak</strong> you might want to make to the code.</p><p>At the moment, we always check for hard-coded string identifiers like <code>"PAYPAL"</code>&nbsp;or <code>"CREDIT_CARD"</code>.</p><p>You typically want to <strong>avoid</strong> this - not primarily for readability reasons but to <strong>avoid errors</strong> (e.g. due to typos).</p><p>Hence it is a better practice to use <strong>globally defined</strong> <strong>enums</strong> - if your programming language supports that - <strong>or</strong> <strong>globally defined constants</strong>.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">const TYPE_CREDIT_CARD&nbsp;=&nbsp;'CREDIT_CARD';
//&nbsp;...
if (transaction.type ===&nbsp;TYPE_CREDIT_CARD) { ... }</pre><p>By doing that, you define a value once (in a place which is easily found and editable) and you then reuse the constant / variable. Hence you can't introduce accidental typos in parts of your code and you also avoid repeating the hard-coded value over and over again. That in turn is helpful if you ever want to change the identifier =&gt;&nbsp;You then only need to change it once.</p>
