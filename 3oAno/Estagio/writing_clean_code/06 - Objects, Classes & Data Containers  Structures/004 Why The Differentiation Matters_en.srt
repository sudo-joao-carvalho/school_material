1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,180
You should care about this differentiation

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,470
because you can end up writing bad code,

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,820
not clean code,

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,250
if you mix these concepts.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,790
Let's say you have this database class

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,230
which has all the logic for connecting and disconnecting.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,920
You could be using such a class

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,140
because you are using an object oriented approach,

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,040
or maybe also because you use a procedural programing style

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,720
but you still use some classes to hold some of the logic.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,100
Whatever you do,

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,700
here you might have this class,

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,410
and this class has everything you need

14
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,670
to connect and disconnect.

15
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,120
So you could use it like this,

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,540
you could instantiate it,

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,810
pass in your connection URL,

18
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,290
pass in this engine,

19
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,330
which you got from somewhere else,

20
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,510
maybe from a third party package,

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,350
and you call connect.

22
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,183
And of course,

23
00:00:54,183 --> 00:00:55,840
you can now also call disconnect,

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,950
and this would be very clean code.

25
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,030
You would be using this object in a clean way,

26
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,390
and the place where you write this code,

27
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,380
which could be in another method of another object,

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,010
would also be very easy to read and understand.

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,330
In addition, whenever de-connection

30
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,610
or disconnection logic changes,

31
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,950
you don't need to make any changes in this part here,

32
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,930
you would just make these changes internally in the class.

33
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,530
Now, if you mix the idea of such a real object

34
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,320
and a data structure,

35
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,920
you could for example have a public connection property,

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,230
which means that this connection is now available

37
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,303
outside of the class as well.

38
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,650
Hence, somewhere else in your application,

39
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,010
you could decide

40
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,010
that you wanna close your database connection

41
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,630
by accessing the database connection

42
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,393
and then call close on it.

43
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,040
Which in the end is what we're doing here

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,800
instead of disconnect in the class as well.

45
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,340
The problem just is the class knows

46
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,010
how to deal with this connection

47
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,020
because it is its main job,

48
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,930
and whenever the logic would change

49
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,930
and close would for example change from close to disconnect

50
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,540
or anything like that,

51
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,570
we would only need to make this change

52
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,170
in that of this one class,

53
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,240
and everywhere where we use it,

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,430
this change would automatically be applied

55
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,343
without changing any code.

56
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,800
If we instead dig into our class like this here

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,390
and we call close ourselves

58
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,510
somewhere else in our code,

59
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,030
then whenever this logic changes,

60
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,570
we need to change this to disconnect

61
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,020
everywhere in the code

62
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,340
where we used our database class like this.

63
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,030
In addition, even if this never changes,

64
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,910
this is harder to read.

65
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,310
All of a sudden here in this place,

66
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,150
where we're just dealing with a database,

67
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,960
we now also need to understand

68
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,510
how to deal with a connection

69
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,790
in addition to dealing with a database.

70
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,150
This is more to understand,

71
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,970
to keep in mind and to read,

72
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,250
and therefore this is not good code

73
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,880
because of multiple reasons.

74
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,230
And that's why this differentiation matters,

75
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,150
there are times when you just need a data container.

76
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,450
For example, as I mentioned before,

77
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,100
when you pass it as a parameter to another method.

78
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,470
But then, there also are times

79
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,510
where you need a real object which hides its logic away

80
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,070
and where you don't dive into the object

81
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,590
to then mess around with it.

82
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,250
So it is fine to use either of the two concepts,

83
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,660
depending on what you plan to achieve,

84
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,450
but you shouldn't mix them as I'm doing it here

85
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,760
by having this public property

86
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,760
and by exposing some internals to the outside world.

87
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,120
That's why this differentiation matters

88
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,280
and why you should keep this in mind

89
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,530
when you are working with classes or objects

90
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,083
in your applications.
