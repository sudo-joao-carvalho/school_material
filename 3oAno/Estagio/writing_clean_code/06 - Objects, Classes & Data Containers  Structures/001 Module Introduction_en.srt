1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,710
This course section will be about classes

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,010
and objects and about keeping your classes and objects clean

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,450
and working with objects in a clean way.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,240
Now, therefore, of course,

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,220
it won't matter to you if you are never, ever working

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,820
with classes or objects in your code,

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,730
but if you do work with classes and objects in any way,

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,430
even if that's not a 100% object oriented style,

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,050
then you will get important information

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,540
out of this course section.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,730
Because we are going to have a closer look at classes

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,850
and objects and we're going to learn

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,750
that we can differentiate between real objects,

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,130
if we wanna call them like this,

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,430
and data structures or data containers

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,810
and what that difference is and why it matters,

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,500
we'll have a look at a bunch of object oriented principles,

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,180
which even help you if you're not following

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,120
a 100% object oriented style.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,019
We're going to have a look at the solid principles there

21
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,633
and at the Law of Demeter.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,060
And we're also going to take another look at polymorphism

23
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,380
and see how classes can also help us with that.

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,950
It is a concept we already had a look at

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,010
in the last course section.

26
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,273
Now we're going to take a look in this section.

27
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,030
Now, this course section we'll still have a couple

28
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,010
of demos and examples,

29
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,020
but it will be a bit more theory than the last sections

30
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,720
because in this section,

31
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,160
we'll have a couple of core principles and guidelines,

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,403
which you should be aware of when working with classes.
