1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,470
Now, before we dive into the different aspects

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,200
I wanna cover in this section,

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,660
let me make one thing very clear.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,570
This course section will not teach you

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,320
Object Oriented Programming.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,980
It will not teach you that.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,260
This is not the focus of this section

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,060
and not the focus of this overall course.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,640
The idea of this course

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,300
is to give you general concepts and rules and ideas,

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,850
which you can follow to write Clean Code

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,110
no matter how you write your code.

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,710
This course is not focused on Object Oriented Programming.

14
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,410
And this section isn't either.

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,780
We are going to explore various concepts

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,390
which come from the Object Oriented Programming world

17
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,400
and which apply to classes.

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,640
But as I mentioned before, this will matter to you

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,240
if you're working with classes in any way,

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,730
even if you don't build your entire project

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,210
in an Object Oriented way.

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,000
Therefore we're also not going to dive into all possible

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,110
Object Oriented Programming Patterns and Practices.

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,090
I am going to cover some important core principles

25
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,710
which you should be aware of,

26
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,870
but this will not be a deep dive

27
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,330
Object Oriented Programming section in general.

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,820
That's simply not the idea behind the course.

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,840
The idea is to give you all the core tools

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,260
you need to write Clean Code.

31
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,740
And for data of course we must not forget

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,330
that Clean Code is simply code which is written

33
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:37,050
such that it's readable and easy to understand by humans.

34
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,990
Now, all of these patterns and principles which exist,

35
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,400
they help you write code

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,670
which has maintainable and extensible.

37
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,350
Of course there is a relation to clean Code.

38
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,680
If you follow these patterns and principles,

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,100
you tend to end up with Clean Code,

40
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,570
but you could also follow a lot of these principles

41
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,760
and still write bad code.

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,190
That's why we definitely focus on the Clean Code part here

43
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,260
instead of covering all possible patterns and principles.

44
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,720
If you are interested in all these patterns and principles

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,580
a course focusing on just Object Oriented Programming

46
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,823
is of course the course you wanna take.
