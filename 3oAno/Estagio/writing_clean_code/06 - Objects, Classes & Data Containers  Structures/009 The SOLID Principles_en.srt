1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,123
So now that we learned

2
00:00:04,123 --> 00:00:05,580
about the Law of Demeter, we should dive

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,700
into a couple of other often cited principles,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,380
which you should be aware of when working with classes

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,380
and especially when writing code in an object oriented way.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,530
And here, amongst the most popular principles,

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,550
we would have the so-called SOLID principles.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,980
We should write classes in a SOLID way,

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,370
and SOLID is an acronym which stands

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,240
for five different principles which you should apply

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,300
to your classes, so which you should respect

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,900
when writing code, to end up with clauses

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,990
which are considered to be well-written,

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,100
extensible and maintainable.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,900
Now here's what these different characters stand for.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,900
The S principle is the single responsibility principle,

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,330
and we're going to have a closer look at these principles

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,113
over the next minutes, of course.

19
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,840
O stands for open-closed principle,

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,260
L for Liskov substitution principle,

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,000
I for interface segregation principle,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,520
and D for dependency inversion principle.

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,180
These are the SOLID principles

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,960
which you typically should follow

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,360
when writing object oriented code.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,240
Now, it's especially the S and O principles

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,450
which also matter to us when writing clean code

28
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,570
because, as mentioned multiple times,

29
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,370
whilst all patterns and principles,

30
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,690
of course, tend to make our code cleaner,

31
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,190
we especially have two principles here

32
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:51,190
which have a very clear impact on the cleanness of our code.

33
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,710
So therefore, let's take a closer look

34
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,200
at the single responsibility and the open-closed principle,

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,500
but, of course, let's also briefly look

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,433
at the other principles over the next minutes.
