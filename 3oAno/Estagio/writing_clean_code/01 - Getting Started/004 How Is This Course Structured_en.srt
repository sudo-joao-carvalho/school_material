1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,230
Now all these course sections in this course

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,820
will follow a certain structure.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,400
We'll always start by diving into the core problems

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,920
and the important rules and concepts you should know

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,650
to solve these problems.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,800
For example, when we talk about naming,

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,970
I will start by explaining how good names look like

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,140
and why they look like this.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,800
So we'll learn about bad code and why it's bad,

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,780
and we'll understand these core rules

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,920
and concepts you should follow.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,070
But theory alone won't do the trick.

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,900
That's why in all these course sections,

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,750
I'll back that theory up with demos and examples.

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,670
We'll see both bad and good code in action,

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,830
and we'll all transform bad code to good codes together

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,220
so that we have a realistic example,

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,870
and we can see that transformation in action

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,133
rather than me just throwing finished examples at you.

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,660
In addition, every section will have challenges for you.

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,810
There are challenges where you can apply what you learned

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,069
and where I challenge you

23
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,670
to analyze and improve and transform some dirty code

24
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,020
on your own.

25
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,010
This ensures that

26
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,880
you don't just learn about these concepts in theory,

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,350
but that instead, you get a lot out of this course,

28
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,760
and you will really remember these concepts

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,653
so that you can use them in your upcoming projects.
