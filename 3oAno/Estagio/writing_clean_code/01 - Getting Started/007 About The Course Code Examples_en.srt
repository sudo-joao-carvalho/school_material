1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,000
Now I got one more thing to say

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,770
about the code examples you will see in this course,

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,020
just to make sure that we're all on the same page

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,633
and there is no confusion.

5
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:13,482
All these examples which you will find in the course

6
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:18,482
and there will be many examples are short, focused examples,

7
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:22,197
always focusing on one specific concept or idea

8
00:00:22,197 --> 00:00:23,770
which I guess makes sense

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,131
because that is what the entire course is about.

10
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:29,973
So these are code snippets and most of them won't execute.

11
00:00:29,973 --> 00:00:32,931
So most of the examples are just small snippets

12
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:36,607
taken from a bigger fictional project

13
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:38,528
so you won't be able to run them.

14
00:00:38,528 --> 00:00:40,490
And I just want to make this clear

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,426
so that there is no confusion.

16
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:45,801
I will still show you valid code and all of that

17
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:49,010
it's just taken out of a bigger project

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,379
taken out of context.

19
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:52,939
And I wanna make that clear and obvious

20
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:55,204
so that you are not confused

21
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:57,750
why this code does not execute.

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,390
The examples also don't use a particular programming style

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,910
or follow a specific paradigm

24
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,960
I'm not doing object-oriented programming in this course

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,648
I'm not doing functional programming,

26
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:12,760
I most of the time have small snippets

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,763
with simple functions or classes

28
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:17,650
and what I teach you will apply

29
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,663
no matter which programming style you are using.

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,832
Now, one note for all the Java and C-sharp developers

31
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:27,840
in JavaScript and in Python

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,150
and in a couple of other programming languages as well

33
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,420
you don't have to wrap everything into a class

34
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,110
as you for example have to do it in Java

35
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,750
that's why you will see standalone functions

36
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,693
which are justifying like this without any classes

37
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:45,390
in all these examples throughout the course.

38
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,972
In Java or a C-sharp these would simply be some methods

39
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:53,610
to find in some root main class you could say.

40
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,250
So that's just something to be aware of

41
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,289
you simply don't need to have classes around everything

42
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:02,003
in programming languages like Python or JavaScript.
