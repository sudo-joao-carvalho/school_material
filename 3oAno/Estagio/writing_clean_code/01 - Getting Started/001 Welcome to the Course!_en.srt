00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,680
Hi, and welcome to this course.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,240
This course is about writing clean code.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,870
And my name is Maximilian Schwarzmuller

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,440
and I will be your instructor in this course.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,010
Now in this course,

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,870
I am going to teach you what exactly clean code is,

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,250
and why it matters to write clean code.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,610
And I'm also going to teach you how you can write clean code

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,380
on your own, which key rules, and concepts, and ideas,

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,630
you should keep in mind when it comes to that.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,760
I'm going to explain why all these rules matter,

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,070
why you should consider following them,

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,490
and I'm going to do all of that with a lot of examples

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,320
and demos so that this is not a theoretic course,

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,850
but actually a course

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,870
with a lot of small snippets and examples.

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,500
Because writing clean code matters.

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,355
It's clean code which ensures that your code base

19
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:54,750
is not just alive today where you know it well,

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,303
but that it also has a chance of surviving.

21
00:00:57,303 --> 00:01:00,170
Because code written in a clean way

22
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,243
as it turns out is easier to maintain

23
00:01:02,243 --> 00:01:04,739
for you in a couple of months,

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,060
but also for your colleagues and team members.

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,177
Now that's the course

26
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:11,720
and all these rules and concepts,

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,977
which we're going to dive into

28
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:15,709
are actually not just my random thoughts

29
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,287
or concepts I came up with,

30
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,660
but instead I went out there

31
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,600
and I gathered all the best practices,

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,563
and patterns, and principles, and rules, and ideas,

33
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:30,600
which I could find, which are related to clean code,

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,030
and I compiled them all into this single resource

35
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,450
so that you have one course

36
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,404
which you can take to learn all the key concepts

37
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:41,123
and rules you should be aware of

38
00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:43,680
when it comes to writing clean code.

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,800
Now, this course is full of content,

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,290
packed with examples and demos.

41
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,640
And in addition, I also give you a couple of resources

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,700
which you can download,

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,260
all the slides for the course

44
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,689
and also a mini ebook where you find all the key concepts

45
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:01,390
and rules in a written form.

46
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,030
So it's not just the videos,

47
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,120
which of course is the main medium of this course,

48
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,661
but it's also this huge PDF document

49
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,830
where you also have all the knowledge to read

50
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,170
in case you prefer that

51
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,610
or simply in addition to the videos.

52
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,700
Now that's the course, that's me,

53
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,810
and that's what you're going to get out of the course.

54
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,906
And therefore of course,

55
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:24,140
let's dive into the most important question.

56
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,773
What exactly is clean code?
