1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,570
So up to this point,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,860
this hopefully all makes sense.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,709
However, you might be wondering which programming language

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:12,020
we're actually going to use in this course.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,680
In this first example, which we transformed

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,890
from dirty code to clean code,

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,600
I used Python as a programming language.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,795
And indeed you will need some programming experience

9
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:28,509
not with Python though, but in general.

10
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:32,106
It does not matter at all which programming languages

11
00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:35,300
you are using in your projects

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,730
and which are courses you are taking,

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,800
but you need some basic programming

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,950
experience to get the most out of this course.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,274
Because this course will not teach you how to write code.

16
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:49,000
It will teach you how to write good code.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,085
And that's an important difference.

18
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:54,580
Now you don't need to be a senior developer or anything

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,590
like that, though.

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,676
You just need some basic experience.

21
00:00:57,676 --> 00:00:59,855
You should have worked on some projects,

22
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:03,281
but you don't need five or 10 years of experience,

23
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:05,530
not at all.

24
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,260
Now let me come back to the programming languages.

25
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,919
In this course, I will mostly use Python

26
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:15,919
and JavaScript slash TypeScript for the examples.

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,857
TypeScript simply is an extension

28
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:19,699
you could say to JavaScript

29
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:23,920
it adds strict typing to the JavaScript language.

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,748
And these are the two programming languages

31
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:30,870
I will use for the examples in this course.

32
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,030
Now, even if you don't know these languages,

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,800
you will be able to follow along.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,420
You don't need to know them.

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,570
I just use them because Python is very popular

36
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,154
and a lot of people know Python.

37
00:01:41,154 --> 00:01:43,627
JavaScript and TypeScript on the other hand

38
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:47,172
are quite similar to Java and C-sharp

39
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:49,230
and languages like that.

40
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,050
That's why I wanted to include

41
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,777
these different languages here.

42
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:55,073
Now, the concepts taught will apply

43
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,620
to all programming languages though.

44
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,890
And if you have that basic experience

45
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,660
which you need, you will be able to follow along

46
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,436
even if you don't know these specific languages.

47
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:09,550
You don't need to know either of these languages.

48
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,360
If you are a C-sharp,

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,170
or a Java, or a Swift, or anything like that developer,

50
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,970
you will still get all the important information

51
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,974
out of this course because the concepts taught

52
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,974
in this course, and the examples shown in this course

53
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:27,570
apply to all programming languages.

54
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,440
It's not specific to Python, or JavaScript, or TypeScript.

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,844
It really applies to all programming languages.

56
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:38,280
Of course, you should be able to read code

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,750
like this and kind of understand it

58
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,509
even if you're not a Python developer,

59
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:43,593
but given the fact

60
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:46,285
that you should have basic programming knowledge

61
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:48,114
that will not be a problem

62
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:52,640
because no matter if it's Python, Java, JavaScript, C-sharp,

63
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,026
or whatever, the core ideas

64
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:58,120
and things in programming languages are always the same.

65
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,045
We have clauses, objects, variables, constants, functions.

66
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:03,750
This is always the same

67
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,970
and therefore the exact programming language as, you know

68
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,110
don't matter, you will get all the important information

69
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,943
out of this course

70
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:14,623
no matter what your favorite programming language is.
