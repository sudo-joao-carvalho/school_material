00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,530
Now, as I mentioned in the last lecture,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,040
this course does not focus

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,780
on a specific programming paradigm.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,350
You can follow along no matter if you wanna do functional,

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,550
object oriented or procedural programming or anything else.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,750
Things like naming things correctly

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,990
and writing good functions will always apply.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,330
Of course, you still might have paradigm specific patterns,

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,140
principles and conventions,

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,270
which you should still take into account

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,439
even after finishing this course.

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,710
So if the style you're using

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,180
or also the programming language you're using

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,860
has extra style guides or rules,

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,570
you should of course still respect these,

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,380
even if that's not covered in this course,

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,210
because this course focuses on general,

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,750
universal clean code rules.

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,180
So of course, don't abandon other rules or concepts

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,210
which might apply to the style you are using.

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,480
Nonetheless, the core principles and rules

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,890
which are covered in this course will always apply.

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,630
No matter which style or programming language you're using,

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,550
it's always about using good, readable and meaningful names.

25
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,830
It's always about having slim and concise functions,

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,150
which are easy to read.

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,690
And of course, you always want an understandable code flow

28
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,410
and no deeply nested, if, statements.

29
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,640
So this will all always apply,

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,530
and therefore the concepts taught

31
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,493
in this course will always apply.
