1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,800
So we know that what you learn in this course

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,270
will apply no matter which kind of code you'll write.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,320
But of course you might know that there are a lot

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,520
of patterns and principles out there.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,150
Some specific for a specific programming language,

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,220
some specific for a specific framework,

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,340
and some specific to a specific programming paradigm.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,380
How are these patterns and principles then related

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,650
to the idea of writing Clean Code?

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,549
Should you always follow them all to ensure

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,860
that you do write Clean Code?

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,970
For this it is important to keep in mind

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,090
that Clean Code is code

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,010
which is readable and easy to understand.

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,500
That is the main thing you have to keep in mind

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,730
when writing Clean Code.

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,634
Now all these patterns and principles out there

18
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:53,260
are focused on ensuring that you write code

19
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,970
which is extensible and maintainable.

20
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,010
Of course,

21
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,370
there is a connection.

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,735
Of course if you follow these patterns and principles,

23
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:03,510
that can help with writing Clean Code.

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,030
On the other hand,

25
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,270
if you name things poorly,

26
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,820
if you format things poorly,

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,560
if you have functions which are super clunky

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,279
and messed up and hard to read,

29
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:17,025
you can follow all these patterns and principles

30
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:20,110
and you would still not have Clean Code.

31
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,100
So this course really focuses on what makes up Clean Code,

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,076
not on all possible patterns and principles you could learn.

33
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:30,030
Of course there are some which matter a lot

34
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,860
when it comes to writing Clean Code,

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,975
and I will therefore cover them in the course,

36
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:37,440
but some other principles are not as important

37
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,080
from a Clean Code perspective.

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,510
And there's one other differentiation I wanna dive in.

39
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,470
And that would be Clean Code versus Clean Architecture.

40
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,736
We can also make a differentiation here.

41
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:51,076
Just as with the patterns and principles,

42
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:53,930
of course there is a connection.

43
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,900
But, Clean Code is really about writing guess what?

44
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,733
Clean Code.

45
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,880
It's about the code you write.

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,730
Now a Clean Architecture

47
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,200
is about how you structure your project,

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,130
how you separate your entities,

49
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,820
how you store your data.

50
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,830
It's in the end,

51
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,540
you could say where to write which code.

52
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,039
Do you use dependency injection or not?

53
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,330
These are questions you ask yourself

54
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,110
when thinking about a Clean Architecture.

55
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,800
And that's a different thing than Clean Code.

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,343
and Clean Architecture also depends a lot on

57
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:32,030
which programming paradigm you're following,

58
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,450
and which programming language you're using.

59
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,720
With Clean Code we focus on single code snippets.

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,590
Single files you could say.

61
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,740
With Clean Architecture we focus on the overall project

62
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,340
and how to model our data

63
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,410
and how to distribute our code.

64
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,863
And this course therefore is about Clean Code.

65
00:02:49,863 --> 00:02:53,253
We'll not focus on things like the repository pattern

66
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:54,980
or anything like that,

67
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,914
because that is not really related to Clean Code.

68
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:00,590
It doesn't matter where you access

69
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,200
your database for example,

70
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,963
from a Clean Code perspective.

71
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:06,350
From a Clean Architecture perspective,

72
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,470
that could matter,

73
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,340
and you should therefore then take a dedicated course,

74
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,120
if that is what you're primarily interested in.

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,563
This course will focus on Clean Code.
