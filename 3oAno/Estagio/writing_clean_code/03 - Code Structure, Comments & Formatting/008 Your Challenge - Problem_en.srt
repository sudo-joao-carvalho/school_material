1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,469
Now we saw all the rules,

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,130
we had a look at all the rules,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,240
and I showed you a couple of examples

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,520
now it's time for your challenge.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,180
So I had to find a challenge py file

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,860
it's therefore written in Python

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,470
and this file has some code,

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,900
you can execute it

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,650
though I would say it would fail,

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,960
you can fix it and you'll find

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,780
ideas on how to fix it in the code file

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,020
but the main priority is not that you fix this file,

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,009
that you can execute it, but that you fix

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,430
the comments and the formatting in the file.

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,330
Not everything is wrong indeed it isn't too bad

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,560
but there are a couple of things which can be improved.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,730
And I want you to go through this file have a look

18
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,010
at all the different comments and the formatting

19
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,520
and the code you see here,

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,560
and see how you could improve it.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,690
And then of course compare your solution to mine,

22
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,283
so that you also see how I transformed this file.
