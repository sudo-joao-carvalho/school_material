1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,400
Now let's move on to horizontal formatting.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,130
With horizontal formatting,

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,510
we are talking about a single line of code

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,100
and that these lines of code should be readable

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,410
without horizontal scrolling.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,680
So we should simply avoid very long unreadable sentences.`

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,370
And that all starts with indentation.

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,320
We should use indentation,

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,850
even if it's not required technically.

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,930
Now here is an extreme example.

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,980
This again is the disk storage class from before,

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,780
with the same code as before, but I changed the constructor.

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,030
I removed all indentation,

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,030
and instead I put all the code in one line,

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,060
it looks like this.

16
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,450
It's a very long line of code

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,583
and we have to scroll horizontally in order to read it.

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,920
This code would execute.

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,760
This is technically valid JavaScript code,

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,610
but of course it's not readable at all.

21
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,430
Hence, we should use multiple lines and also indentation,

22
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,220
to make it readable.

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,010
Because like this, it's perfectly readable.

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,390
If we just had multiple lines, but no indentation at all,

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,440
and if it looked like this,

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,560
therefore it would be readable.

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,950
But especially for longer functions,

28
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,640
it's not necessarily immediately obvious

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,530
that this code all belongs in one and the same function.

30
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,750
So using multiple shorter lines and using indentation

31
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,340
helps a lot with code readability and understandability.

32
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,650
Now, in addition to using indentation,

33
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,960
you should also break long statements

34
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,730
into multiple shorter ones.

35
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,670
And with that, I don't just mean the extreme example

36
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,770
I showed you a minute ago.

37
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,030
For example, consider line 19 here.

38
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,720
I changed this line to be a bit longer

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,630
because I'm not referring to this storage path

40
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,970
property of the class anymore, which holds the storage path,

41
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,290
but I'm creating the path in line instead.

42
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,820
And therefore we have a rather long line here.

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,800
In such cases, it would be better to extract this code

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,093
into a separate variable or constant,

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,700
like this for example,

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,090
and then use this variable or constant.

47
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,840
Now, it's way more readable,

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,200
even though it's the same code as before,

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,880
but we simply split this long line into multiple lines.

50
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,090
Now, last but not least,

51
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,200
when it comes to horizontal formatting,

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,910
you should also use clear and descriptive,

53
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,960
but not unreadably long names.

54
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,950
Names of variables and properties and methods

55
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,290
can be a bit longer.

56
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,910
This is totally fine, they can consist of multiple words.

57
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,060
But consider this extreme example,

58
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,040
I now renamed this constant to be very descriptive.

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,330
It's the storage path

60
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,030
for storing images in a temporary folder, for the year 2020.

61
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,070
Now, this is a very descriptive name,

62
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,000
but it doesn't help with readability.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,740
It's simply too long.

64
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,000
It hides the rest of the line,

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,160
which would actually be more explanatory than the long name.

66
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,470
Because if we would see this code immediately,

67
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,730
it would be pretty clear

68
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,400
that we are creating a images folder in some temp folder,

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,790
which is somehow related to the year 2020.

70
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,210
This would be much clearer

71
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,680
than if we have to read this long name.

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,500
In addition, this long name does not just impact line 19,

73
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,630
but also line 20, where we use this long name.

74
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,170
This line now also is partially hidden

75
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,060
and requires some scrolling,

76
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,470
of course, always depending on your zoom level,

77
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,750
but still it's a way too long line.

78
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,280
And hence here, the older name was definitely better

79
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,553
and helped with readability way more.
