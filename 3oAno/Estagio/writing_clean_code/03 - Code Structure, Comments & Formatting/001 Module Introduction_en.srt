00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,120
In the last course section

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,200
we learned how proper naming can help us

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,980
with the code readability

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,590
and therefore with the maintainability of code.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,820
In this course section,

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,780
we're going to dive into things we can do beyond naming

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,000
things to improve readability

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,250
or to hurt it as you will learn,

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,660
because this section is about comments

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,240
and code formatting,

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,049
and it turns out that both can be used to improve our code

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,060
or to make it worse.

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,070
Therefore, we'll learn that comments are mostly bad,

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,610
but I will also explain

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,560
which kind of comments would be good.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,430
We will learn that code formatting is important

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,330
and how to format our code,

18
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,210
also how to adhere to language conventions.

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,760
And of course, again, we'll have examples, demos,

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,900
and a challenge for you so that you again,

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,870
are able to apply all these concepts, not just in theory,

22
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,713
but also in your own project.
