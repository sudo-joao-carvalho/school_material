1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,360
Now where comments can rarely help

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,150
and often hurt our code,

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,040
code formatting is another thing which is really helpful,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,260
when it comes to improving the readability

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,840
and understandability of our code.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,010
Because code formatting improves readability

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,730
and helps us transport meaning across our code.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,180
And we can differentiate

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,700
between two kinds of code formatting,

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,370
vertical formatting and horizontal formatting.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,490
Vertical formatting

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,050
simply refers to any formatting any code structuring we do

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,350
from the top to the bottom of our file.

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,760
So vertically.

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,550
That includes spacing between lines and grouping of code.

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,150
And I will show you concrete examples in just a second.

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,680
Horizontal formatting on the other end

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,530
is everything which happens within one line of code.

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,510
So horizontally.

20
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,010
And that involves indentation,

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,730
space between code in one line of code,

22
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,830
and of course in general the width of our code lines.

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,530
Now when it comes to formatting and formatting properly,

24
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,200
it is of course true that formatting is important

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,500
and helps us with code readability,

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,630
but only if it's done properly.

27
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,840
And here we'll not just have some general rules

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,360
and concepts which I will show you over the next lectures,

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,430
but we'll also have language specific formatting rules.

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,400
Where most of the concepts shown in this course

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,150
apply across all languages.

32
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,730
We also have formatting rules

33
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,320
which differ between different programming languages.

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,510
And is always the general conventions

35
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,980
and style guides of these languages,

36
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,800
which you wanna follow when it comes to formatting.

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,770
So for example, if you think about indentation

38
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,940
something I will come back to in a second,

39
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,640
and you will think about whether you wanna indent by

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,360
two spaces or four spaces, or by using taps.

41
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,440
Then it's always also the language guidelines

42
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,910
and style guides which you will typically find,

43
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,740
which answered the question on how to indent properly.

44
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,870
So you never wanna forget about these.

45
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,509
Nonetheless, there also are some general rules

46
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,700
and concepts, which always apply.

47
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,610
And these are the rules and concepts,

48
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,280
we're now going to have a closer look at.

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,770
So let's now take a closer look

50
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,100
at these two kinds of formatting's

51
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,000
and let's understand which kind of rules

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,303
we should follow there.
