1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,318
Now. That's it for this course.

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,469
I hope you enjoyed it.

3
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,872
I hope you got a lot out of this course.

4
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,274
And I can only encourage you

5
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,226
to keep on learning.

6
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:11,310
Don't stop here!

7
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,496
Because taking a course is great

8
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:15,231
- and I got more courses

9
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:16,732
if you want to dive deeper -

10
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:18,901
but if you want to master something,

11
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:19,518
if you want to get

12
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:21,687
really good at something,

13
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:24,106
you have to apply what you learned.

14
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:25,524
You have to use it.

15
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:28,043
Use it in your day to day projects.

16
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,895
Build demo projects

17
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:31,947
where you apply what you learned.

18
00:00:32,214 --> 00:00:34,216
Make sure that you don't lose

19
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:35,250
that knowledge

20
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,102
because taking a course

21
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:39,137
gives you that solid foundation,

22
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:41,873
but you only become good at something

23
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:44,025
if you then use that foundation

24
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:44,693
to use it

25
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:46,111
in your day to day work,

26
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:48,446
in your everyday work, in your projects.

27
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,698
And therefore, I would

28
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:50,098
of course

29
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:52,217
love to see you in other courses.

30
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:53,601
But either way, I wish you

31
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,386
all the best for your future.
