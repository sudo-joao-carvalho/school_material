1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,610
This course section is about staying clean.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,950
I want to ensure that you're really able

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,450
to apply what you learned

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,170
and that you can take the next step and write better code

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,280
than you maybe did before.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,280
And for that, the most important rule,

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,609
which you must not forget.

8
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:23,609
Clean code is equal to readable and understandable code.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,310
Whatever helps this goal.

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,500
So whenever you do something which improves readability

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,570
and understandability, it makes your code cleaner.

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,670
This is really important to keep in mind.

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,920
It's not about checking 10 different rules

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,890
which you apply to your code.

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,030
It is about writing readable and understandable code.

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,030
That is the ultimate goal.

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,630
Don't forget this.

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,670
Also, don't forget that whilst we didn't focus

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,740
on a specific programming paradigm or style

20
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,323
or language in this course,

21
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,940
the rules and concepts taught in this course

22
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,430
will always apply.

23
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,380
You always want to have readable and meaningful names.

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,720
You always want to have slim, concise

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,990
and clean functions.

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,100
And you always want to have an understandable control flow

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,270
and no nested if statements.

28
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,340
So this all always applies.

29
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,120
Now, this course didn't focus

30
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,530
on a specific programming paradigm

31
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,930
like object oriented programming,

32
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,140
instead, what you learned, as I just mentioned,

33
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,970
will always apply.

34
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,110
Nonetheless, of course also keep paradigm specific

35
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,850
or programming language specific conventions, style guides,

36
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,200
and rules in mind,

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,290
and apply them in combination with what you learn here.

38
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,890
For Python, for example,

39
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,920
follow the PEP 8 aid style guide

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,800
so that you follow all the common best practices

41
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,350
for the specific language and style you use.

42
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,640
And then in addition, of course, apply what you learn here

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,860
to ensure that you're not just following some style guide,

44
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,773
but that you do everything to write clean code.

45
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,710
Also keep in mind what I said in the first course section

46
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,570
about clean code and patterns and principles.

47
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,009
Not all patterns and principles help you with clean code.

48
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,840
I mean, they will always help to some extent,

49
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,170
but often they focus on giving you a clean architecture

50
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,370
or on keeping your code extensible and maintainable.

51
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,650
And that of course is important, don't get me wrong.

52
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,980
But for clean code,

53
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,220
there are more important principles

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,930
and less important principles.

55
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,290
And I had a look at some of the most important principles

56
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,420
throughout this course.

57
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,650
So always also keep that in mind.

58
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,550
Of course you want to follow all the best practices

59
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,390
and principles for your given programming language

60
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,640
or framework,

61
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,670
but for clean code also always keep in mind

62
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,310
that not all principles will automatically

63
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,730
give you clean code.

64
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,890
This is important because it's easy to write bad code,

65
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,723
even though you follow all these principles.
